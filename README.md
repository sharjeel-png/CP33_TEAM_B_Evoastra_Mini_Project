# 🕸️ CP33_TEAM_B_Evoastra_Mini_Project

### Evoastra Data Science Internship – Mini Project (October 2025)
Web Scraping Mini Project by Team B (CP33) under Evoastra Data Science Internship — extracting and analyzing Honda car data from Cars24.com using Python, Selenium, and Pandas.

---

## 📘 Project Title
**Web Scraping Car Details from Cars24.com using Selenium**

---

## 🎯 Objective
The goal of this mini project is to **gain practical experience with automated web scraping** using **Selenium WebDriver** to extract structured car data from [Cars24.com](https://www.cars24.com/).  

**Team B (CP33)** is assigned to focus on the **Honda** brand, scraping car listings from the **Mumbai** location.  

By the end of this project, interns will have:  
- Automated browser control with Selenium  
- Extracted structured data from dynamically loaded web pages  
- Cleaned and organized data using Pandas
